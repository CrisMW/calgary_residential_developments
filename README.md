# Are neighbourhoods with public transit in demand?
## An analysis of residential development permits in Calgary

This analysis looks at residential develop permits in the City of Calgary. The goal was to determine whether neighbourhoods close the city's light rail transit (LRT) are in higher demand through a series of visualisations. These showed that there is, indeed, more residential development in areas closer to transit. Unrelated to the original question, the analysis also showed a sharp increase in the number of secondary suites since 2018. Contractors and realtors may, thus, benefit from targeting homeowners who are looking to develop secondary suites in their houses.

For this analysis, residential permits were extracted and grouped by neighbourhood. Then, the annual growth rates were calculated and plotted as bar graphs. Next, a choropleth map was generated to visualise the absolute number of permits for each neighbourhod. It clearly showed that residential developments decline when moving away form the city's LRT lines. This would suggest that proximity to rapid transit does actually positively affect residential developments.
